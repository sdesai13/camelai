# CamelAI Landing Page Clone

This repository contains a clone of [CamelAI's](https://camelai.com) landing page. All design credits and rights belong to CamelAI. This project was created as part of a take-home assignment for **AllMindAI** by **Shwetang Desai**.

## Features
- Fully responsive landing page
- Modularized React components (Navbar, Hero Section, Badges, FAQ, etc.)
- Styled using modern CSS techniques
- Includes animated scrolling marquee and call-to-action buttons

## Stuff missing
- The colors and styling are not a 100% replica of the original, but they closely follow the same design principles and are nearly identical in appearance.
- The icon grid slideshow is currently not implemented in this version. Given more time, I would be able to incorporate it seamlessly into the landing page.
- The embedded video is not an exact match to the original, as I had difficulty locating the correct version. However, I have done my best to replicate it as closely as possible.
